# Quickstart Guide
1. From the Assets/Create menu, navigate to Assets/Create/Bardic Bytes/EventVars/ for all included EventVar types like BoolEventVar and StringEventVar and create a new EventVar asset.
2. Reference this EventVar asset from a script or UnityEvent such as on a Unity UI Button component.
3. Add listeners via script or use an EventVarListener component to react to the event being raised.
